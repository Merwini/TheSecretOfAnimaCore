	- requires a pawn sacrifice?

Buildings:
	- Anima sap tap
		- produces anima sap over time

Process to refine sap into amber

Creatures (submod):
	- kodama, small tree spirits
	- Kukonochi, the kami of trees

Other:
		- Anima tree no longer affected by all artificial buildings, only those that use electricity
	- Killing anima trees gives relations penalty with witches of mind, bonus with witches of body, once I make factions
	- researches will be gated by story events, once I make story mod
	- lineage submod for generations playthrough?
		- weapons and armor bind to pawn, can only be passed down to children, get stronger with each generation
		- ritual to sacrifice a pawn, give strong long-term buffs to bloodline (sacrifice grandma when she is too old to contribute)

Evolving anima tree in the style of anomaly monolith
	- monolith breakpoints are based on entities encountered, so need something different for tree
	- quests to capture special psychically-attuned world pawns and merge them with the tree?
