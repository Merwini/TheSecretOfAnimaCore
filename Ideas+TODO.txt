	- requires a pawn sacrifice?

Buildings:
	- Anima sap tap
		- produces anima sap over time
		- can be set to different rates of production, higher rates produce more sap but damage the tree to varying degrees (also produce screams)

Process to refine sap into amber

Creatures (submod):
	- kodama, small tree spirits
	- Kukonochi, the kami of trees

Other:
		- Anima tree no longer affected by all artificial buildings, only those that use electricity
	- Killing anima trees gives relations penalty with witches of mind, bonus with witches of body, once I make factions
	- researches will be gated by story events, once I make story mod
	- lineage submod for generations playthrough?
		- weapons and armor bind to pawn, can only be passed down to children, get stronger with each generation
		- ritual to sacrifice a pawn, give strong long-term buffs to bloodline (sacrifice grandma when she is too old to contribute)
